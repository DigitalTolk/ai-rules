# .gitignore Rule for Nuxt 3 + Vite + TypeScript + PWA + Playwright

This rule defines the recommended .gitignore entries for a modern Nuxt 3 project using Vite, TypeScript, PWA features, and Playwright for E2E testing.

## Recommended .gitignore Entries

```
# Nuxt build and dev outputs
.nuxt
.output
.nitro
.cache
dist

# Node dependencies
node_modules

# Logs
logs
*.log

# Misc
.DS_Store
.fleet
.idea

# Local env files
.env
.env.*
!.env.example

# Playwright E2E outputs
playwright-report/
playwright/.cache/

# PWA/Service Worker
public/manifest.webmanifest
public/service-worker.js

# .cursor rules and metadata
.cursor/

# VSCode and editor settings
.vscode/
*.swp

# Test coverage
coverage/

# OS generated files

Desktop.ini
```

## Guidelines
- Always keep sensitive files and local environment files out of version control.
- Ignore build outputs, logs, and IDE/editor settings.
- Exclude Playwright and PWA generated files.
- Exclude the .cursor directory to avoid committing rule metadata.
