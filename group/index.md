# DigitalTolk UI Component Group Rules

This document serves as the central index for all component group integration rules in the DigitalTolk UI library. These rules provide guidance on how to use related components together to create consistent and effective user interfaces.

## Available Group Rules

Each group rule focuses on a specific category of components and covers implementation guidelines, best practices, common patterns, and testing considerations for using these components in combination.

| Group Rule | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Layout Components](mdc:layout.mdc) | Guidelines for using layout components such as Card, Grid, Space, and Divider |
| [Form Components](mdc:form.mdc) | Guidelines for implementing forms with components like TextField, Select, Checkbox, and Radio |
| [Display Components](mdc:display.mdc) | Guidelines for content display components like Alert, Avatar, Table, and Tag |
| [Navigation Components](mdc:navigation.mdc) | Guidelines for navigation components such as Link, Button, Tabs, and Menu |
| [Specialized Components](mdc:specialized.mdc) | Guidelines for specialized components like Chart, Calendar, and TextEditor |

## Usage

These group rules are designed to be used in conjunction with the individual component rules. While individual component rules focus on the specifics of each component, group rules provide a holistic view of how related components can be used together effectively.

### When to Use Group Rules

- When building a complex interface with multiple related components
- When designing consistent patterns across an application
- When looking for guidance on component combinations
- When implementing common UI patterns like forms, dashboards, or navigation

### How to Use Group Rules

1. Identify the category of components you're working with
2. Refer to the appropriate group rule
3. Follow the implementation guidelines and best practices
4. Use the provided code examples as a starting point
5. Check your implementation against the testing checklist

## Best Practices

### 1. Consistency
- Follow the patterns and guidelines established in the group rules
- Use consistent styling and behavior across related components
- Maintain a cohesive look and feel throughout the application

### 2. Composition
- Combine components in logical and intuitive ways
- Use container components to organize related UI elements
- Consider the hierarchy and flow of information

### 3. Responsiveness
- Test component groups on different screen sizes
- Use responsive layout components like Grid
- Adapt component arrangements for mobile and desktop

### 4. Accessibility
- Ensure all component groups are accessible
- Test keyboard navigation within component groups
- Provide proper ARIA attributes for related components
